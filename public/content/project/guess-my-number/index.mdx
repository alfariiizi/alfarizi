This is a simple game where the user will guess a secret number between 1 and 20. If the guess is too high, there will be a "too high" warning, indicating that the secret number is lower. At the start of the game, the user is given a score of 20, but with each incorrect guess, the score decreases by 1.

This simple game is a self-study exercise from [Course Jonas](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). As per Jonas' instructions, I initially wrote this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, when I started learning React.js, I tried to recreate the game with React.js. With the help of Tailwind CSS, the result became responsive, though I realized that the size of the node_modules folder is quite large due to the use of React.js.

To play the game, you can open the link provided above. Hope you enjoy the game!
