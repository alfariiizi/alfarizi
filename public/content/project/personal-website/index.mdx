## Tech Breakdown

### General Tech

- **Next.js 14** App Router: The backbone of my website, Next.js 14, utilizes the App Router feature for optimized routing and enhanced performance, allowing for a smooth and dynamic navigation experience.
- **TailwindCSS**: This utility-first CSS framework provides highly customizable, low-level styles directly in my HTML, leading to a streamlined development process and a consistent design system.
- **Shadcn-UI**: For consistent and reusable UI components, I use Shadcn-UI, which integrates seamlessly with TailwindCSS to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Framer Motion**: To add fluid and engaging animations, Framer Motion is employed, enabling complex animations and transitions with ease.

### Home Page

**Rough Notation** is used to bring attention to key points. This library creates fun and interactive annotations, enhancing the user experience by making important information stand out.

### Blog
