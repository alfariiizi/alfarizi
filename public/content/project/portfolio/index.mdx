This is my first portfolio. It's quite simple indeed. I worked on it without any design knowledge. At that time, I liked brutalist and pixel design, so I tried my best to combine both in the design. This portfolio led me to my first frontend job at [DataIns](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datains-global-data-inspirasi/mycompany/).

I built this portfolio using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. If you're interested in seeing the portfolio, you can visit it now. The link is provided above. I hope it can inspire your own portfolio.
