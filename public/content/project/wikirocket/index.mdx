WikiRocket is a Wikipedia search engine. You can search for many topics here. All the topics you find here are articles from Wikipedia. This project is my first project using the Next.js framework (Next.js 13). It is a self-learning project from the [Dave Gray Nextjs Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6Pk-QJIdGd1tGZEzy9RTgtj&si=loeAEPD9OJof_rb8). In this project, I also used TypeScript for the first time with a React.js-based framework.

If you are curious about WikiRocket!, you can visit the website directly. The link is provided above. I hope this project can inspire your other projects.
