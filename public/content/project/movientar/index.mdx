Movientar is my first project to learn using an API with React.js, specifically [Movie DB (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org) API. TMDB is a film and TV series database that also provides an API for its database. In this project, I used React.js and Tailwind CSS.

On the Movientar website, there are several categories to choose from. If you're curious about the website, you can visit it directly. The link is provided above. I hope it can serve as a reference for your other projects.
