From the name alone, it's pretty self-explanatory. This blog website was used to store all the blog posts I wrote. However, over time, that blog has been replaced with the one you are visiting now.

<Callout>
  You can see all my blog posts by clicking `blog` on the navbar or by clicking <Link href="/blog">this link</Link>.

My old blog was a continuation of my learning process using Next.js. Here, I learned a lot about server components, static generation, and dynamic pages in Next.js. I wrote that project in TypeScript. For styling, I used Tailwind CSS (I'm a big fan of Tailwind CSS ðŸ˜¸).

If you're curious about my old blog, you can visit it now. The link is provided above. I hope this project can inspire you in developing your personal projects.
