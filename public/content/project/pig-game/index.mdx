This is a simple multiplayer game where users take turns rolling dice. For example, there is user-1 and user-2. If user-1 rolls a 1, the turn switches to user-2. User-1 or user-2 can continue rolling the dice until they roll a 1 or press the "Hold" button. For more detailed rules, you can read [wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)>).

Just like <Link href='/images/project/guess-my-number'>guess my number</Link>, this simple game is also a self-study exercise from [Jonas Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). Following Jonas' instructions, I initially wrote this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
