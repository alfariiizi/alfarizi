## My Contribution to Robota

Robota is an AI-assisted, real-time hotel review analysis tool based on Online Travel Agencies (OTA). I began managing this project as a **Frontend Developer** since **May 2023**.

Previously, Robota had a comprehensive set of features, but they were all built on top of vanilla react.js (from CRA) version 16. This setup led to complex coding workflows that resulted in erratic outputs—sometimes loading, sometimes showing results, and sometimes errors. Additionally, using vanilla react.js significantly slowed down the development process. For instance, changing a paragraph's text required about a minute to see the update in the browser.

Due to overall poor feedback on Robota’s UI/UX design, a redesign was deemed necessary. At the same time, I saw this redesign as an opportunity to completely overhaul the frontend tech stack.

In **September 2023**, I proposed a fundamental change to the frontend tech stack. The primary change involved using _Next.js 13 App Dir_ as the framework for the frontend, supplemented with technologies like _shadcn-ui_, _react-query_, _zustand_, _zod_, and _trpc_. My proposal was approved by the Tech Lead, Product Manager, Team Leader, and all members of the Frontend Team. Consequently, there are two versions of Robota: the version before September 2023 (old version) and the version after September 2023 (new version). By December 2023, the old version was completely phased out, and [robota.app](https://robota.app) now hosts the new version of Robota. After redesigning and updating the tech-stack, Robota received positive feedback from its users, because the application design has become better (thanks to the UI/UX Team of Robota), and the application has become more stable (rarely errors appear).

## Conclusion
