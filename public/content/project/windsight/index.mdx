## My Contribution to Windsight

Windsight is an application that displays data insights from several platforms. To date, the platforms utilized include: Superset, Google Looker Studio, and Tableau. I was first tasked with leading Windsight in January 2024 as a Frontend Developer.

With my experience managing [Robota](/project/robota), I was appointed to determine the tech stack for Windsight. Generally, the tech stack I selected is similar to that of Robota, but with several optimizations to ensure that 90% of data fetching is performed on the server using the Server Component feature from Next.js App Dir. Utilizing Server Components has made the application faster during data fetching. I specifically discuss this topic in my article titled: [Mengapa kita perlu menggunakan React Server Component](/blog/mengapa-kita-perlu-menggunakan-react-server-component).

Currently, one of the users of Windsight is the Samarinda City Government. The dashboard includes various data from the Samarinda City Government presented in graphical form.

> As of now, I am still in charge of the Windsight product.
